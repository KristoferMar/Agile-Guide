<h2>Agile Retrospective</h2>
The retrospective are there for us to reflect our last sprint. <br>

Identify how to improve teamwork by reflecting on what worked, what didn’t, and why. We recommend running a Retrospective with your team every couple of weeks or at the end of a project milestone. <br>

Retrospective should only take around 30 minutes. <br>
The retrospective should be consits of the following for the holder <br>
1. Preparation <br>
- Whiteboard, stickynotes, timer, this can also come through Mural <br>

2. Set the stage <br>
- Remind everyone to keep an positive spririt. <br> 
- Don’t make it personal, don’t take it personally <br>
- Listen with an open mind <br>
- Everyone’s experience is valid <br>
- Set the time period you’re discussing (last sprint, last quarter, entire project, etc.) <br>
- Focus on improvement, rather than placing blame <br>
- Set the stage in a way so we are very clear that this is a meeting for a productive feedback of the current work. <br>

3. What went well <br>
- Distribute sticky notes and recover what went well <br>
- Use 2-3 minutes to come up with everything we are thinking about <br>
4. What needs improvements <br>
- Focus on what didn't go great <br>
- What could we have done better? <br>
5. Next stpes <br>

- 2-3 minutes to write what we can do to improve our work <br>
- Each team member have 3 votes each <br>
